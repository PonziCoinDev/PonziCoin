            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    PonziCoin is a daring and ruthless experiment in Solana - a Ponzi-inspired system built to amplify high-risk, high-reward dynamics. It fully embraces the unpredictable nature of speculative investing, and unlike other projects, PonziCoin is honest about its mechanics. It’s transparent because everyone knows exactly what they’re getting into: a ponzi. The system thrives on rapid decisions and a constantly expanding participant base.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    At PonziCoin, we pride ourselves on being completely upfront about the rules and risks. There are no hidden conditions or false promises. Every participant understands the stakes, and every decision is a calculated gamble.
                </p>

                <h3>Risk Warning</h3>
                <p>
                    Participation in PonziCoin comes with extreme financial risks. The system is designed for those who fully understand and accept that they will either lose everything or potentially walk away with a fortune. There are no safety nets. Think carefully before participating—once you're in, there are no guaranteed exits.

                        <h3>Investment & Exit Conditions</h3>
                        <p>PonziCoin X is built to reward bold decisions and strategic risk-taking. Once an investment is made, there’s no simple way to withdraw it. However, there are two ways you can access your funds:
                            <br><br>
                            1. Ponzi-Roulette™: You can risk part or all your funds in the Ponzi-Roulette. If you win correctly, you’ll receive your full investment and potential profits in SOL. However, if you lose, you walk away with nothing. For more details, check the "Ponzi-Roulette" section.
                            <br><br>
                            2. Referral-Based Exit: You can generate 2x your original investment by bringing in new participants. Each investor receives a unique referral link, which allows new users to purchase the coin. More details on this strategy can be found in the "Referral Commissions" section.
                            <br><br>
                            These options ensure a high-stakes environment where every decision matters. Choose wisely, as the path you take will determine your ultimate outcome.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="referral" class="feature-item">
                        <h3>Referral Commissions</h3>
                        <p>At PonziCoin, expanding your network is key to unlocking higher rewards. You’ll receive a unique referral link to invite new investors to the system.
                            <br><br>
                            Once your link has generated capital worth 2x your initial investment, you’ll gain the ability to withdraw without restrictions. Any additional capital earned through referrals will qualify for daily returns.
                            <br><br>
                            Your returns are influenced by both your initial investment and the total capital brought in through your referral link. Details on return rates and conditions will be announced soon.
                        </p>

                <!-- Zweite Reihe: 2 Features -->

                    <div id="roulette" class="feature-item">
                        <h3>Ponzi-Roulette™</h3>
                        <p>Ponzi-Roulette™ is designed for those who are willing to take high risks for the chance of significant rewards. It’s a simple but intense game of chance where you can bet part or all of your funds on a coin-flip-style wager.
                            <br><br>
                            Here’s how it works:
                            <br><br>
                            • You choose between red or black before the spin.
                            <br><br>
                            • If you guess correctly, you’ll receive 100% of your original investment back, plus any profits from the increased coin price.
                            <br><br>
                            • If you guess incorrectly, you lose everything you bet.
                            <br><br>
                            To add even more excitement, the biggest winners and losers of Ponzi-Roulette™ are publicly displayed in the Hall of Fame and Hall of Losers, offering bragging rights—or public shame. For more information on these leaderboards, check the relevant section.
                            <br><br>
                            Important: Participation in Ponzi-Roulette™ is completely voluntary but comes with high risks. Think carefully before betting, as one move could cost you everything—or get you everything.

                            The Hall of Fame celebrates the players who triumphed in PonziCoin Roulette™. These are the winners who outsmarted the odds, securing massive rewards. Their success is a testament to strategy, luck, and the thrill of the game. They’ve risen above, proving that with the right moves, anyone can come out on top.
                            <br><br>
                            Welcome to the Hall of Losers, where the bold and foolish come to rest. These are the players who thought they could beat the system, only to have it spit them out. It’s not pretty, but hey, someone’s gotta fill this spot. If you find yourself here, don’t worry, you’re in good company—nobody’s perfect... except the winners, obviously. Try again, or don’t. We honestly don’t care.
